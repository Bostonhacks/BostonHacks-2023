            “I go to a ton of hackathons and BostonHacks is consistently one of
            the best that I continue to sponsor year after year. At BostonHacks,
            you get the best hackers in both Boston and the Northeast at large.
            Without fail, the projects that come from these student developers
            are unique and awe-inspiring. I’m not really sure how the organizers
            manage to attract such talent, but it might be that good hackers
            flock to events that are well-run. But never mind all of that. The
            great food is the real reason to go to BostonHacks!”

            “ITG’s technical mentors had a great time at BostonHacks 2017. The
            organizers were responsive and accommodating, allowing us to focus
            on what really mattered—exchanging ideas, providing guidance and
            tackling challenges. We met dozens of talented students, resulting
            in several intern hires and top prospects for future programs. The
            high quality and innovative hacks made this a can’t-miss event for
            us.”

            wrapping their minds around the given problems and come up with
            solutions by the end of the event. I was amazed at the talent.”
